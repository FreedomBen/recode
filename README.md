# Recode

`recode` is an experimental project to play around with the great
[`sourceror`](https://github.com/doorgan/sourceror) package.

For now, `recode` reformats the code in some cases where the Elixir formatter
doesn't make any changes (see Usage below).

## Installation

`recode` is not yet available in Hex. If you want to give it a try, you can
install the package from GitHub:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:recode, git: "https://github.com/hrzndhrn/recode.git"},
  ]
end
```

## Usage
